				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					This is a simple website that I created for my Web Development class. It is a basic website that has a home page, an about page, and a contact page. The home page has a brief introduction to the website, the about page has a brief introduction to me, and the contact page has a form that can be filled out to send me an email. The website is written in HTML, CSS, and PHP.
